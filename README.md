A simple Pong game built entirely in C++ using my custom game engine, powered by the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) library.
The game features a custom object management system inspired by Unity's GameObjects, as well as a custom tweening library [raytween](https://github.com/SebasKoria/raytween), designed to simplify animations within the game.
